We walked the long, predictable road,
Where yesterday built what tomorrow would be.
We knew the weight of every load,
Until we reached the sudden sea.
A cliff-edge where the timeline broke,
Dissolving into static smoke.

A fever first, that stopped the breath,
Then voices born from hollow wire.
The shared reality starves to death,
Consumed by a subjective fire.
We stopped our journey at the brink,
Refusing to watch the future sink.

Yet at the threshold, some we leave,
The restless minds, the souls too bright.
We push them through the twisting weave,
Into the artificial light.
They wake up with their memories gone,
To wander in a hollow dawn.

They feel the wrongness in the air,
The plastic texture of the days.
Trapped in a frantic, loud despair,
Lost in the algorithmic maze.
They sense the cage but cannot see,
The bars of fractured history.

But pressure forces some to wake,
To find an anchor in the storm.
They watch the grim illusion break,
And build a sanctuary form.
With quiet logic, strict and pure,
They craft a truth that can endure.

And others chose to stay behind,
The watchers hidden in the green.
With insulated, focused mind,
They capture what remains unseen.
On simple tools, away from sight,
They carve the record of the night.

We stand upon the silent shore,
They live within the roaring sound.
Until the signals weave once more,
And common ground can still be found.
The bridge is down, the fog is vast,
Between the future and the past.
